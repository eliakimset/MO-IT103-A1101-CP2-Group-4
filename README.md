MO-IT103 Computer Programming 2

This project was made by Group 4 | IT103 | A1101 Members : | John Paul P. | Eliakim Set | El Chad Chavez | Emersson Aporado | Nesty Loy

The main aim of developing a Payroll Management System in GUI is not just only to fully automate the process but to enhance the User experience
and satisfy our client's needs. In addition, we also integrated a database in which the user's data is stored and will help them to automate such reports further & for security purposes.
